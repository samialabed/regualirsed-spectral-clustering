# Regualirsed-spectral-clustering
A reconstruction of Understanding Regularized Spectral Clustering via Graph Conductance[1] 
Testing was conducted on [SNAP dataset](http://snap.stanford.edu/data/)[2].


Change parameter in regularized_spec to choose whether or not to log operations, save plots, or which algorithm to use.
